# Week 12

This week's lab is meant to introduce you to the idea of time series: curve fitting, time series data, and forecasting with Prophet. In particular, we'll cover the following:

- Fitting Curves
- Smoothing
- Facebook Prophet

Note: **The *prophet-diagnostics.ipynb* lab is completely optional.** Take a look if you like, but don't worry if you'd rather stick to the basics!
